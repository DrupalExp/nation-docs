# 9. Blog

Nation theme is using Article content type for displaying blog post. Except 2 default view modes are: Teaser & Default, we create 2 new view modes called Teaser 2 & Teaser 3 to present your blog with several different blog layouts.

We use Display Suite module which allows you to take full control over how your content is displayed using a drag and drop interface instead of template files.

There are 4 pre-defined layouts in Nation Blog:

* Blog Teaser Layout 
* Blog List Layout 
* Blog Single Layout 
* Blog Dark Slider Layout
